|Data Structure to store the turtles, Data Structure to store the colors, A public method that contains a loop to iterate through the data structure, An __str__ method on the class to print out step 6 -- for the turtles, what specific information would be useful? An init method to set the turtles to the data structure includes error checks and documentation on the read me to utilize the class you create.| As you can see, the screenshot above shows me implementing a class that stored my color for the turtles. It also stored the shape of the turtle I needed such as a square or a triangle. These 2 characteristics were the body of my code. These 2 things were the key components for me to finish this code. One key thing I added was start positions which allowed my code to go to the next spot so I could finish the assignment. This is how I completed the code using mostly the instructions from PLTW and an idea of mine - positions.|
